## Install, Update, and Uninstall:

<br>

### Install the source code:

```
cd ~/
mkdir raspberrypi-backlight
cd raspberrypi-backlight/
git clone https://github.com/WestleyK/rpi-backlight
cd rpi-backlight/
make
sudo make install
```
<br>

### Should you install the pre-compiled code?

**Why install the pre-compiled:**
 - No dependency needed to install, (not that there is any).
 - You don't need golang to compile the source code.

**Why not to install the pre-compiled code:**
 - May not be fully compatible, (could only be partially compatible)
<br>

### Install with one line:

Copy-paste this in your terminal:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WestleyK/rpi-backlight/master/easy-install.sh | sh
```
This will install `rpi-backlight` to the current directory.

To finish the install, do:
```
sudo mv rpi-backlight /usr/local/bin/
```
<br>

#### Install by cloning repo:

```
cd ~/
mkdir raspberrypi-backlight
cd raspberrypi-backlight/
git clone https://github.com/WestleyK/rpi-backlight
cd rpi-backlight/pre-compiled/
sudo ./make.sh install
```

<br>
<br>

### Update:

Update the repo:
```
cd ~/raspberrypi-backlight/rpi-backlight/
make update
make
sudo make install
```

Or just update the binary:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WestleyK/rpi-backlight/master/easy-install.sh | sh
sudo mv -f rpi-backlight /usr/local/bin/
```
Basically the same commands as installing the binary.


<br>
